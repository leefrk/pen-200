-----------
On disk evasion:

Packer, such as UPX, generate an executable that is not only smaller but is also functionally equivalent with a completely new binary structure

Obfuscators reorganize and mutate code in a way that makes it more difficult to reverse-engineer

Crypter software cryptographically alters executable code, adding a decryption stub that restores the original code upon execution

In-Memory evasion (focuses on the manipulation of volatile memory):

Remote Process Memory Injection, inject the payload into another valid PE that is not malicious, WriteProcessMemory

Reflective DLL Injection, load a DLL stored by the attacker in the process memor

Process Hollowing, process is removed and replaced from memory, then process resumed

Inline hooking, introducing a hook into a function to make it point to our malicious code

-------------
Base64 encoding converts binary data (like images, files, or any non-text data) into a string of printable ASCII text, it is used to hiding binary data within text environments that have restrictions on special characters, ensuring it passes validation

VirtualAlloc

-----------
Shellter tool is a dynamic shellcode injection framework used by offensive security professionals and malicious actors alike to evade antivirus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems
